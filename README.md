3D Solar System Visualization

A dynamic and interactive web application that visualizes the Solar System in both 3D and 2D modes, showcasing planetary sizes, orbital speeds, revolution speeds, and the Earth-Moon system's revolution. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, this project leverages Three.js for 3D rendering and provides a toggle to switch between 3D and 2D views.
